        In IMPOSSIBLE mode, you have the possibility to do IMPOSSIBLE things like dismantling the existing political and
        economic infrastructure.<br />
        If you do, it will be CHAOS: you will start in DEBT with VERY LOW income. You will have to rebuild society from
        scratch.<br />
        However, you will have access to POLITICAL measures of UNPREDICTABLE effect.<br />
        Do you want to dismantle the existing political and economic infrastructure?
