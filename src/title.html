        DISCLAIMER<br />
        This is a game and a work of fiction that takes place on an imaginary cyberpunk dystopia ravaged by
        capitalism.<br />
        It focuses on the climate crisis because the data was easy to obtain and model, but it is important to note that
        the mechanisms illustrated by this game are omnipresent in this fictional society.<br />
        The normalization of the status quo by extremist capitalist forces is causing deaths and suffering in
        many more ways than only environmental ones.<br />
        The status quo is not morally neutral. Inaction kills.
