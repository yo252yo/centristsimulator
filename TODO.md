difficulty implementation

skip button for marketplace
real game (out of the box thinking): where do you find ideas outside of capitalism? real politic? => Think, its a place of real thoughts and experimentation and trying things, im not sure it exists in the world. grand political narrative/ideology box/radical ideas  


======================


alert dismissed with keyboard dont trigger compassion fade increase
ideally each death would be its own popup and make you click as many times as there are death
i need to stay paused when dismissing popup otherwise it'll just stay in loop. mb i can grey out the screen in pause.

popup on death should black out the rest and be pretty and have death info and so on
tooltip on mouseover
options menu to deactivate death and have a centrist mode etc...
mobile version
game over screen
victory screen
tutorial/onboarding
look overhaul
balance check
music and sfx
force normal difficulty for first playthrough

compassion fade should subsist within runs or simply be easier on second run
